# sqlWrap

## Class for wrapping the .NET "System.Data.SqlClient" commands and gives an object oriented interface for easy database querying.

## About:

This class was made because of the need to have one code for several similar projects and to avoid repetition and for the ease of edit and maintenance.

This class was made before I hear with "SQLinq" and "Entity Framework" and even after using those I found it much simple and easier.

After using it for several years I found it very useful and decided to share it with others.
